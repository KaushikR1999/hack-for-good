## Inspiration
Our application, habitouch was inspired by trending social media applications such as Instagram and Tiktok. We started analysing how these applications manage to engage the audience so well and attract the large number of users. One learning point we got was that these social media allows users to have very close interaction with each other. Thus, we wanted to create an application that would allow the public to interact with these underprivileged families in various ways as a means to raise awareness.

## What it does
Our application provides a centralised platform that allows the public to view information about families and their housing conditions worldwide. Various functionalities such as donation, and viewing of project progress can all be done within the app. Users are able to chat with organisers or the victims involved in the project, creates a more personal connection.

## How we built it
The application was built using the Dart programming language with the aid of the Flutter framework.

## Challenges we ran into
We are all univerisity students with our own lessons and projects to work on. Hence, we had to manage our packed schedules and work on this app. Moreover, some of us were not familar with the techstack used, hence we had to learn this and do work on it.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We worked on the app for about 3 days. We had quite a few ideas to implement and we are happy to have implemented most of our ideas. Also we are glad that we spent lots of time brainstorming and redefining our idea before coding out the app. We got some of our friends to try this out and we are glad to have received positive response as well as feedback that we managed to address.

## What we learned
Through this hackathon, we learnt more about the various challenges faced by organisations such as Habitat for Humanity in their bid to make the world a better place. Through the process of building Habitouch, a few of us also learnt how to make an app using the Flutter framework and Dart. 

## What's next for Team Habitouch
We hope that Habitat for Humanity as well as other NGOs will be involved in Habitouch and be apart of this central platform whereby users are able to view the different projects across the different NGOs.
